- Attention Clustering is better cluster than combined
- Combined CLustering matches Attention Clustering
- Sleep Clusters act as better indicators for concussions
- Stricter number of Features seems to improve concussion predictions on Sleep
- Smaller negative Influence on Beetwen number of features and Attention
- Concussion rates seem to differ massively from traditional classifications of contact and collison
- Larger number of features seem to in closer to expected results with sleep data
- Relationship between sports and concussions seems more complex than expected
- Deeper analysis on relationships between sleep and concussion history might be required
- Distinguishing High Concussion Sports vs Average people seems to be problematic
- Restrictive Sleep seems better than More inclusive sleep data

Determining results using current data seems quite difficult


Perhaps Bring up Kyles work
- Decoorelating outside factors that may also cluster may be important for future research
